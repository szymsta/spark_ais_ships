# Spark AIS Ships

This project processes AIS (Automatic Identification System) data, which is sourced from [Kystverket](https://www.kystverket.no/en/navigation-and-monitoring/ais/access-to-ais-data/), with their permission, in accordance with their license terms. The project leverages Apache Spark to load, clean, analyze, and visualize ship data, ultimately producing a map with ship locations.
